## Phase 3: Query Pipeline

### 3.1 Document Processing

- [X] Implement user document handling
- [X] Support multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, text)
- [X] Extract and clean document text
- [X] Split into logical sections or chunks

### 3.3 LLM Integration

- [X] Implement GeminiInterface class
- [X] Design effective prompts for compliance analysis
- [X] Implement context injection with retrieved regulations
- [X] Format LLM responses for readability

- [X] Implement web application (Flask or Streamlit) (Basic structure and display logic complete)
- [X] Secure document upload (Handled by Streamlit; further hardening if needed during deployment)
- [X] Document preview and section selection (Partially implemented: Chunk selection post-analysis exists, no pre-analysis preview/selection)
- [X] Interactive compliance report display (Implemented; parsing based on current LLM output format)
- [X] Citation linking to source regulations (Partially implemented: Citations displayed, not linked; Requires URL in metadata and retrieval fix)

## Phase 5: Testing and Evaluation

### 5.1 Unit Testing

- [X] Implement tests for individual components
- [ ] Test scraper functionality (Requires robust implementation or sample data)
- [X] Test text preprocessing (1 test skipped due to known HTML subsection issue)

- [ ] Test LLM prompt handling (Verification needed)

### 5.2 Integration Testing

- [X] Test end-to-end workflows (Basic query pipeline test exists)
- [ ] Test full ingestion pipeline (Blocked: Requires relevant sample data or working scraper)
- [X] Test query pipeline with different document types (Tested with sample data for retrieval; LLM analysis pending)
- [ ] Test edge cases (large documents, unusual formatting) (Blocked: Requires varied sample data)

### 5.3 Evaluation

- [ ] Implement evaluation metrics
- [ ] Evaluate retrieval relevance (precision/recall) (Initial tests show low relevance; needs improvement/better data)

### Next Steps

1. ~~Complete PDF handling in text preprocessing~~
2. ~~Optimize chunk size for embedding quality~~
